                    <p>Growing up in different places has been a life-altering experience that's had a profound effect on who I am. It's helped me see different walks of life, and has contributed to my open minded approach to our world, and us.</p>
                    <p>Life really isn't much different living in other countries once you've had some time to adapt. It starts to feel like home once you start to understand the culture and people. The differences that exist show just how much we take the way we do things for granted.</p>
                    <p>Language-wise, I learned English and Spanish at the same time, and took two years of Russian while living in Uzbekistan. I've retained my Spanish speaking here in Texas and using it at jobs I worked.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle"><b>Short answer:</b> I'm reliable, energetic, fun to work with, and always determined to deliver quality work together.</p>
            <div class="about-working-columns">
                <div class="about-working-content">
                    <p>Lately, I've come to see <i>'work'</i> more as as <b>goals we accomplish together</b>, and <i>'coworkers'</i> as <b>teammates that help us get there</b>. I love finding new ways to get things done, and love sharing my findings with others so we all have the tools we need to succeed.</p>
                    <p>I like to keep things real — telling jokes, having fun, and overall: <b>staying excellent.</b></p>
                    <h3>Handling Feedback and Criticism</h3>
                    <p>If you're reading this, we both know this is part of this job. It just doesn't work if you can't tell someone that their design's not gonna cut it because you're worried about hurting their feelings. At the end of the day, every decision we make is a <b>bet</b>. One of the goals of UX design is to ensure these bets are <i>good</i>. The kinds you can go all in on. <b>Data is king</b>—wise words once said by a good friend—continue to reign true each day. It's about making great bets and creating quality content.</p>
                    <p>If I make a bet, I believe in it as much as I believe in myself, and would love to hear your feedback so I can keep improving myself.</p>
